Why docker-compose is here
- It provides a quick, local multi-service test without Kubernetes so you can validate routing and endpoints first.

How to use it
- Run `docker compose up --build` and hit:
  - http://localhost:8000/healthz
  - http://localhost:8001/healthz
  - http://localhost:8002/healthz
  - http://localhost:8003/healthz

What to change later
- Replace placeholder dependency installs with a shared base image or uv-based install once the Python packaging is finalized.
