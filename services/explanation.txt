Why this service outline exists
- Service contracts define inputs/outputs early so the Helm chart and demo flow are grounded before any model code is written.

What is included
- A minimal API surface per service (paths + payload shape) to keep integration clear.
- Required health and metrics endpoints so autoscaling and observability can be demonstrated.
- A small, CPU-friendly resource budget that matches the Optiplex hardware.

How to build on it
- Implement each service with FastAPI and keep request/response models in a shared schema module.
- Add Prometheus metrics via a lightweight exporter (e.g., prometheus-client).
- Start with stubbed responses, then swap in real models once traffic flow is stable.

Updates in this step
- Added a root pyproject.toml so uv can install dependencies and run services locally.
- Added services/__init__.py so Python treats services as a package.
- Added per-service Dockerfiles so each app can run in a container.
