Why this script exists
- Helm templates can be validated without a cluster. This catches YAML errors early and keeps changes safe.

How to use it
- Run `scripts/render-helm.sh` to render the local values to stdout.
- Swap in `values-eks.yaml` if you want to validate the EKS overrides.

What to extend later
- Add `helm lint` or a second render for EKS once you have a CI pipeline.
